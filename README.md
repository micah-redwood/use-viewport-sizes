a tiny React hook which allows you to track visible window viewport size in your components w/ an optional debounce or custom memo function for updates for optimal rendering.

## Installation ##

```
npm install -D use-viewport-sizes
```

## Benefits ##
- extremely lightweight and dependency-free -- **3.75kb** without/before gzipping.
- only one `window.onresize` handler used to subscribe to any changes in an unlimited number of components as well despite several different paradigms that pull from this.
- optional debounce to delay updates until user stops dragging their window for a moment; this can make expensive components with size-dependent calculations run much faster and your app feel smoother.
- debouncing does not create new handlers or waste re-renders in your component; the results are also pooled from only one resize result.
- optional hash function to update component subtree only at points you would like to.
- supports SSR (see example under Usage section).

*Interact with the example shown on CodeSandox* @

</center>

### **Without Debouncing**
*registers dimension changes on every resize event immediately*

```js
import React from 'react'
import useViewportSizes from 'use-viewport-sizes'

function MyComponent(props) {
    const [vpWidth, vpHeight] = useViewportSizes();

    ...renderLogic
}
```


### **With Debouncing**

If passed a number as the first argument, it registers dimension changes only when a user stops dragging/resizing the window for a specified number of miliseconds. This is useful for listening to expensive components such as data grids which may be too
expensive to re-render during window resize dragging.
```js
import React from 'react'
import useViewportSizes from 'use-viewport-sizes'

function MyExpensivelyRenderedComponent (props) {
    const [vpWidth, vpHeight] = useViewportSizes(1000); // 1s debounce

    ...renderLogic
}
```

### **Only update vpW/vpH passed on specific conditions**
If passed a function as the first argument, it will use this to calculate a hash that only updates the viewport when the calculation changes. In the example here, we are using it to detect when we have a breakpoint change which may change how a component is rendered if this is not fully possible or inconvenient via CSS `@media` queries. The hash will also be available as the 3rd value returned from the hook for convenience.
```js
import React from 'react';
import useViewportSizes from 'use-viewport-sizes';

function getBreakpoint({ vpW, vpH }) {
    if(vpW < 640) {
        return 'md';
    }
    if(vpW < 320) {
        return 'sm';
    }
    else if(vpW < 240) {
        return 'xs';
    }
    else {
        return 'lg';
    }
}

function MyBreakpointBehaviorComponent() {
    const [vpW, vpH, bp] = useViewportSizes(getBreakpoint);

    // do-something-with-breakpoints in render
    // and add new update for vpW, vpH in this component's
    // subtree only when a named breakpoint changes
}
```


### **Server Side Rendering**

*While serverside rendering is supported, it requires an explicit update via `useEffect` since viewport does not actually exist on the server before rendering to client. The following has been tested with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).*

*Sidenote that you will see a `useLayoutEffect` warning from React. This is perfectly normal as there is no viewport/context to paint to when pre-rendering in SSR and will not interfere with your app once served to the client*

```js
import React, { useLayoutEffect } from 'react'
import useViewportSizes from 'use-viewport-sizes'

function MySSRComponent (props) {
    const [vpWidth, vpHeight, updateVpSizes] = useViewportSizes()

    // below, we add one post-render update
    // in order to register the client's viewport sizes
    // after serving SSR content

    useEffect(()=> { updateVpSizes(); }, []);

    ...renderLogic
}
```
