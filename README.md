a tiny React hook which allows you to track visible window viewport size in your components w/ an optional debounce and
other flexible options for optimal usage.

## Installation ##

```
npm install -D use-viewport-sizes
```

## Benefits ##
- extremely lightweight and dependency-free -- **3.75kb** without/before gzipping.
- only one `window.onresize` handler used to subscribe to any changes in an unlimited number of components as well despite several different paradigms that pull from this.
- optional debounce to delay updates until user stops dragging their window for a moment; this can make expensive components with size-dependent calculations run much faster and your app feel smoother.
- debouncing does not create new handlers or waste re-renders in your component; the results are also pooled from only one resize result.
- optional hash function to update component subtree only at points you would like to.
- supports SSR (see example under Usage section).

### **Basic Use-case**
*registers dimension changes on every resize event immediately*

```js
import React from 'react'
import useViewportSizes from 'use-viewport-sizes'

function MyComponent(props) {
    const [vpWidth, vpHeight] = useViewportSizes();

    ...renderLogic
}
```

### **Measure/Update only on one dimension**

If passed `options.dimension` as `w` or `h`, only the viewport width or height will be
measured and observed for updates.
The only dimension returned in the return array value will be the width or height, according
to what was passed.

```js
import React from 'react';
import useViewportSizes from 'use-viewport-sizes';

function MyComponent(props) {
    const [vpHeight] = useViewportSizes({ dimension: 'h' });

    ...renderLogic
}
```


### **With Debouncing**

If passed `options.debounceTimeout`, or options are entered as a `Number`, it registers dimension changes only when a user stops dragging/resizing the window for a specified number of miliseconds. This is useful for listening to expensive components such as data grids which may be too
expensive to re-render during window resize dragging.

```js
import React from 'react';
import useViewportSizes from 'use-viewport-sizes';

function MyExpensivelyRenderedComponent(props) {
    const [vpWidth, vpHeight] = useViewportSizes({ debounceTimeout: 1000 }); // 1s debounce

    // ...renderLogic
}
```

### **Only update vpW/vpH passed on specific conditions**
If passed an `options.hasher` function, this will be used to calculate a hash that only updates the viewport when the calculation changes. In the example here, we are using it to detect when we have a breakpoint change which may change how a component is rendered if this is not fully possible or inconvenient via CSS `@media` queries. The hash will also be available as the 3rd value returned from the hook for convenience.

```js
import React from 'react';
import useViewportSizes from 'use-viewport-sizes';

function getBreakpointHash({ vpW, vpH }) {
    if(vpW < 640) {
        return 'md';
    }
    if(vpW < 320) {
        return 'sm';
    }
    else if(vpW < 240) {
        return 'xs';
    }
    else {
        return 'lg';
    }
}

function MyBreakpointBehaviorComponent() {
    const [vpW, vpH, bp] = useViewportSizes({ hasher: getBreakpointHash });

    // do-something-with-breakpoints in render
    // and add new update for vpW, vpH in this component's
    // subtree only when a named breakpoint changes
}
```


### **Server Side Rendering**

*Note: While serverside rendering is supported, it requires an explicit update via `useEffect` since viewport does not actually exist on the server before rendering to client. The following has been tested with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).*

*Sidenote that you will see a `useLayoutEffect` warning from React. This is perfectly expected as there is no viewport/context to paint to when pre-rendering in SSR and will not interfere with your app once served to the client*

```js
import React, { useLayoutEffect } from 'react'
import useViewportSizes from 'use-viewport-sizes'

function MySSRComponent (props) {
    const [vpW, vpH, updateVpSizes] = useViewportSizes();

    // below, we add one post-render update
    // in order to register the client's viewport sizes
    // after serving SSR content

    useEffect(()=> { updateVpSizes() }, []);

    // ...renderLogic
}
```
